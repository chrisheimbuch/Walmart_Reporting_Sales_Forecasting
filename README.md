 This project an EDA and technical analysis using Regression and various machine learning models to predict the future sales of Walmart. 

I focused on using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Modified ARIMA, and SARIMA, (Seasonal ARIMA) models. After reviewing the graphs and trend of Walmart sales within the dataset, Walmart has seasonal booms, with sales spiking dramatically around November and December for the holidays. This is important and as such, a SARIMA model was used. The results were very impressive, and I used it to predict an additional 52 Week period. There are many factors that can impact a forecast; complexity of markets, data quality and availability, external shocks and black swan events, economic cycles and structural changes, time sensitivity and much more. Many finance organizations use manual models to predict future forecasts, and the use of machine learning can be another tool in a companies arsenal to add value and create even more accurate forecasts within the Finance and Data analysis departments.
